# Parallax Scrolling

This project showcases a modern and visually appealing website with a parallax scrolling effect. Parallax scrolling is a popular web design technique where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth and immersion. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement and demonstrate the parallax effect in a responsive and accessible manner.



## Features

- Smooth Parallax Scrolling: Background and foreground elements scroll at different speeds to create a seamless and engaging user experience.
- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that the parallax effect looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
